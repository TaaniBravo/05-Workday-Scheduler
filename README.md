# Work Day Scheduler

This is the homework assignment for week 5 of UW Coding Bootcamp. Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS (using Bootstrap) powered by jQuery.

This program is using momentJS for its time elements.

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My Journey
```
The implementation of third-party APIs really streamlined me through this project. I actually did not need to outsource my learning basically at all and just relied on studying the API documentations and trial and error to see what worked. This really helped give me an understanding of not only why the code worked but also why these APIs are so awesome. They really help create some amazing programs with ease with what would otherwise be very daunting. 

The hardest part was getting my textareas to be color coded to the current time and the likes. This took me the longest and also helped me get in the groove of using jQuery the most.
